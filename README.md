# Animations-SwiftUI
This project is the sample app to demonstrate animation in IOS using swift and swiftUI.

Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully understand what’s going on.

Go back to the Guess the Flag project and add some animation:

When you tap the correct flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis.
Make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity.
And if you tap on the wrong flag? Well, that’s down to you – get creative!
